## My process 🏗️

### Built with 🛠️

- React
- SCSS

### What I learned 🧠

### Regular expressions 📜

In order to create effective validation, i implemented *regular expressions*, commonly abbreviated as *regex*

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```
